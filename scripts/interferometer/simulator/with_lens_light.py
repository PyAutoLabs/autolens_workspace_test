__Simulate__

For simulating interferometer data of a strong lens, we recommend using a Grid2D object with a `sub_size` of 1. This
simplifies the generation of the strong lens image in real space before it is transformed to Fourier space.

To perform the Fourier transform we need the wavelengths of the baselines, which we'll load from the fits file below.

By default we use baselines from the Square Mile Array (SMA), which produces low resolution interferometer data that
can be fitted extremely efficiently. The `autolens_workspace` includes ALMA uv_wavelengths files for simulating
much high resolution datasets (which can be performed by replacing "sma.fits" below with "alma.fits").

__Ray Tracing__

Setup the lens galaxy's mass (SIE+Shear) and source galaxy light (elliptical Sersic) for this simulated lens.

For lens modeling, defining ellipticity in terms of the `ell_comps` improves the model-fitting procedure.

However, for simulating a strong lens you may find it more intuitive to define the elliptical geometry using the 
axis-ratio of the profile (axis_ratio = semi-major axis / semi-minor axis = b/a) and position angle, where angle is
in degrees and defined counter clockwise from the positive x-axis.

We can use the `convert` module to determine the elliptical components from the axis-ratio and angle.
