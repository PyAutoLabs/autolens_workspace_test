"""
Run the workspace smoke test suite.

Reads `smoke_tests.txt` from the workspace root and `config/build/profile_smoke.yaml`
for per-script env var overrides, then runs each listed script with the
appropriate environment. Continues through failures and exits non-zero
if any script failed.

Each script is capped at `BUILD_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT` seconds (default 300), the same
env var and default PyAutoHands's `build_util.py` uses, so the PR gate and the
release runner agree about how long a script may take. On expiry the script's
whole process group is killed and the entry is reported as TIMEOUT.

The env resolution itself is NOT implemented here: it is PyAutoHands's
`autohands/env_config.py`, imported below. This file used to carry a copy, and
the copy had already drifted (its `load_env_config` hardcoded the smoke
profile path, so the PR gate was structurally unable to read
the release profile — the seed incident's failure mode 4/7). One resolver
means the PR gate and the release runner cannot disagree about what a script's
environment is. See PyAutoHands docs/env_profile_redesign.md §5 (#161 step 2).

Mirrors the logic of the `/smoke-test` skill so CI and local runs stay
in sync.
