"""
Run the workspace smoke test suite: the scripts listed in `smoke_tests.txt`.

Nothing about discovery, exclusion, environment resolution, per-script timeouts
or reporting is implemented here. This is a thin shim over PyAutoHands'
`autohands/run_python.py` — the same entry point PyAutoHeart's
workspace-validation uses — so the PR gate and the validation runner cannot
drift apart.

This file used to be a 198-line copy of that machinery, one of ten across the
workspace repos. Each of the last three fixes to it — the env-resolver fork
(PyAutoHands#185), the per-script timeout and process-group kill
(PyAutoHands#226/#227), the jupyter guard — had to be swept across every copy by
hand, while the HowTo repos needed none of them precisely because they hold no
logic. `--list` (PyAutoHands#261) closed the last gap: the shared runner was
opt-out only, and this workspace's coverage is opt-in.

What the shared runner provides:

  * the allowlist in `smoke_tests.txt`, run in that file's own order
  * per-script env from `config/build/profile_smoke.yaml`, via the one resolver
  * the `BUILD_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT` cap and the process-group kill on expiry
  * a structured JSON report, and a non-zero exit when anything failed

`config/build/no_run.yaml` is deliberately NOT applied here. It is policy for
the release mega-run and notebook generation; `smoke_tests.txt` is policy for
this gate, and a script legitimately appears in both (PyAutoHands#262).

`--report-dir` is REQUIRED, not cosmetic. run_python.py only propagates failures
(`sys.exit(1)`) when a report was built; without it the suite runs to completion
and always exits 0 — a vacuously green gate.
